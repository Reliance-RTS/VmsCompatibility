# VmsCompatibility

A collection of subroutines that implement or emulate the functionality of
certain OpenVMS system service routines. These routines may be useful when
migrating a DBL application from OpenVMS to another platform.

Included in this environment are both a Workbanch workspace file and a
Visual Studio solution. Open one of these in your preferred IDE and use the
build command to compile and link the ELB which is named VMSLib.elb.
